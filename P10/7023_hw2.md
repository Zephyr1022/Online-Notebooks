##  SKEWNESS

*Skewness* is a *measure* of the departure of the distribution of a random variable

calculate **skewness** and **kurtosis** that can be used to test the normality of a given data set. normality tests are used to determine whether a data set is modeled for normal distribution. **[[link]](https://help.gooddata.com/doc/en/reporting-and-dashboards/maql-analytical-query-language/maql-expression-reference/aggregation-functions/statistical-functions/predictive-statistical-use-cases/normality-testing-skewness-and-kurtosis)**



- Graphical methods include the histogram and normality plot
- Statistically, two numerical measures of shape – *skewness* and *excess kurtosis* – can be used to test for normality. **If skewness is not close to zero, then your data set is not normally distributed.**
  - If skewness is less than -1 or greater than 1, the distribution is highly skewed.
  - If skewness is between -1 and -0.5 or between 0.5 and 1, the distribution is moderately skewed.
  - If skewness is between -0.5 and 0.5, the distribution is approximately symmetric.



##### ::The null and alternative hypotheses for the normality test are:: 

- **Null hypothesis**: The data follows a normal distribution.

- **Alternative hypothesis**: The data does not follow a normal distribution.



Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a random variable about its mean. It represents the amount and direction of skew.

##  KURTOSIS

Kurtosis tells you the height and sharpness of the central peak, relative to that of a standard bell curve.
