### Schedule 

I am attaching some journal articles with annotated introductions. You can (but don’t have to) use these as examples and follow their structure as you write an introduction for your final paper.

 

Also, this is a rough number of pages each section of your final paper should have:

-**Intro: 3-4 pages (double-spaced)**

-Hypothesis development: 6 pages

-Method and Analysis: 6 pages

-Conclusions and limitations: 2 pages

Of course, you can deviate from the exact number of pages, but proportionally, hypothesis development and methods sections should be the longest, followed by the intro, and then conclusions. 

 

I received a question about whether I am going to penalize you if your paper is less than 15 pages. My answer is no, I will not give you a lower “grade” simply because your paper is shorter than 15 pages. But I will give you a lower grade, if your paper is missing critical information. And, if your paper is substantially shorter than 15 pages, it probably IS missing important information.



### Research Proposals

Xingmeng Zhao

- The purpose of this study is to study whether live streaming     events holding on social networking sites such as Facebook, Zoom, Meetup,     and so on, will increase feelings of connectedness to decrease the mental     health problems, like depressive symptoms, stress, and loneliness, and     improve emotional and social connections during the pandemic period,     further change the human behavior in the way of people communication and     interaction.

- Research Questions: The virtual events now span most popular     categories including working from home, wellness (mediation, yoga, Zumba),     job networking (tech, coding, business), and support around COVID-19     (healthcare/essential workers. It becomes more widely used due to the     social distancing, which have positive effect on conquer feelings of     isolation during the pandemic period? And would this change the human     behaviors of communication to defense pandemic outbreak?

- The reason why this research question interesting and     important is that based on the past study, much research shows people   communicate online primarily with people with whom they communicate     offline-their relatively strong social ties-and their online communication     supplements rather than replaces their offline communication. But due to     the social distancing, most offline meetings change to online. Our normal     online and offline social relationship are totally changed. Some research     shows that online social networking may cause psychiatric disorders, such     as symptoms of depression, changes in self-esteem, and Internet addiction.     But because of social distancing now, people also suffer the loneliness     and social isolation. Now more and more people are involving in the online     live events. It is interesting to know how humans influence and adapt to     changing environmental conditions.

- The contribution I am intend to make with this study is to     shifting consensus. 

- The research strategy that I am going to use is combining     surveys and online behavioral data

- The theory and literature using to build rationales for the     hypotheses is Cultural evolution in the digital age by Alberto Acerbi and     Darwinism Extended: A Survey of How the Idea of Cultural Evolution Evolved     by Chris Buskes

  

 

==============================

Having low confidence and high anxiety is a difficult struggle. A lot of times it can be hard to socialise with people face to face as well as online. Starting a live streaming channel was one of the many steps I have taken to improve my confidence and reduce anxiety in social settings. While in the past, I thought it might be helpful to share some of my personal experiences, as I have had people in the past tell me they’ve wanted to try out streaming or YouTube but felt too anxious to do so. 



With everything going on in the world at the moment it is hard for mental health to not take its toll for some. With not much to do around the house, I decided to try out live-streaming a few days a week to see if I could build up some confidence when it comes to making conversation. Socialising is something I have always found difficult, even with my own family, so I started streaming first without a face camera on and only replying to people within the text chat.



I have found that streaming can be useful for people who like to plan and schedule daily routines or goals, the feeling of achievement after a stream can be a great one. It can also give you a chance to get creative and make interesting schedules, stream art and even emotes if art/graphics is your sort of thing. It can be great experience to have on your CV or to talk about in job interviews as something you have been self-motivated to do.
