### Using SVM to Predict Stock Price Changes from Online Financial News



https://www.scientific.net/AMM.157-158.1586	



### Abstract:

Many technical analysis use financial indices to predict stock price changes. In this paper, we present a different approach for prediction stock price fluctuations using financial news. Our method approaches the stock price prediction problem from an information retrieval perspective. We apply both text analysis and **pattern** classification techniques to search for important online news that are relevant for stock price changes. First, the online financial news and the corresponding stocks are extracted. Then we apply Support Vector Machine (SVM) to construct a model that predicts the price changes for the stocks. Finally, the stock changes prediction model is used to classify and extract upcoming important financial news. The experimental results demonstrate our method is effective for seeking the important financial news for stock price changes.

### [Stock prediction + news sentiment with SVM in R?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56903900/stock-prediction-news-sentiment-with-svm-in-r)

I would like to predict the stock prices and news sentiment score together with SVM in R, in order to see whether news have an impact on stock price and their prediction. I read that support vector machines (svm) are a good machine learning approach for this problem. I have one column that represents the date of the stock and news, one column represents the stock prices on that day and 4 columns which represent the sentiment scores based on different lexica. I would like to test first with one of that lexica and if the models works, trying on the other. The dataset is included below. I found some examples with python but couldn't found something for R. I like to use the `svm()`function from the `e1071 package`
