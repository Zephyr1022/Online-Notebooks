### Assignment 3 [Visualizing_Understanding_CNN_Implementation](https://github.com/FHainzl/Visualizing_Understanding_CNN_Implementation)



This assignment goal is to visualizing and understanding Convolution Networks by visualizing the activation maps of convolutional layers as well as those of deconvolutional layers. 



The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.

The data set used throughout this example is CIFAR10, consisting of 60000 training images and 10000 test images of size 32x32. The data samples fall into 10 classes. The following is a sample of one batch of the input images with their respective classifications:
