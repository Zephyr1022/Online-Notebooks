One group annotated the comments with- out context, while the other group was given the same comments, this time along with the parent comment and the title of the thread as context.



The result shows.. 



We also found that context can both amplify 



To investigate the second question



To investigate whether adding context can benefit toxicity detection classifiers, we could not use CAT-SMALL, because its 250 comments are too few to effectively train a classifier. 

- Develop large dataset 

 (a) does context affect the human judgement, and (b) does conditioning on context improve performance of toxicity detection systems? We experiment with Wikipedia conversations, limiting the notion of context to the previous post in the thread and the discussion title.

the performance of toxicity classifiers, having tried both simple and more powerful classifiers, having experimented with several methods to make the classifiers context aware, and having also considered the effect of gold labels obtained out of context vs. gold labels obtained by showing context to the annotators. The lack of improvement in system performance seems to be related to the fact that context-sensitive comments are infrequent, at least in the data we collected.
